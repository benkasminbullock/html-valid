=head1 NAME

HTML::Valid::Tagset - data tables useful in parsing HTML

=head1 SYNOPSIS

[% example("tagset-synopsis") %]

[% INCLUDE "version.pod" %]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains several data tables useful in various kinds of
HTML parsing operations.

All tag names used are lowercase.

=head2 This module and HTML::Tagset

This is a drop-in replacement for L<HTML::Tagset>. However,
HTML::Valid::Tagset is mostly not based on HTML::Tagset. It uses the
tables of HTML elements from a C program called L</HTML Tidy> (this is
not the Perl module L<HTML::Tidy>).

As far as possible, this module tries to be compatible with
HTML::Tagset. Incompatibilities with HTML::Tagset are discussed in
L</Issues with HTML::Tagset>.

=head2 Validation

If you need to validate tags, you should use, for example,
L</%isHTML5> for HTML 5 tags, or L</%isKnown> if you want to check
whether a tag is a known one.

=head2 Terminology

In the following documentation, a "hashset" is a hash being used as a
set. The actual values associated with the keys are not significant.

=head1 VARIABLES

None of these variables are exported by default. See L</EXPORTS>. The
compatibility with HTML::Tagset is listed. In all cases, the
compatibility with HTML::Tagset refers to HTML::Tagset version 3.20.

=head2 @allTags

This contains all the HTML tags that this module knows of as an array
sorted in alphabetical order. It is exactly the same thing as the keys
of L</%isKnown>.

This is only in HTML::Valid::Tagset, not in HTML::Tagset.

=head2 %canTighten

This is copied from HTML::Tagset.

=head2 %emptyElement

This hashset has as values the tag names of elements that cannot have
content.  For example, "base", "br", or "hr".

[% INCLUDE "empty-element.pl" | xtidy %]

outputs

[% INCLUDE "empty-element-out.txt" | xtidy %]

This is compatible with HTML::Tagset.

=head2 %isBlock

This hashset contains all block elements.

This is only in HTML::Valid::Tagset, not in HTML::Tagset.

=head2 %isBodyElement

This hashset contains all elements that are to be found only in/under
the "body" element of an HTML document.

This is compatible with the undocumented
C<%HTML::Tagset::isBodyElement> in HTML::Tagset and the documentation
for C<%HTML::Tagset::isBodyMarkup>. See also L</Issues with
HTML::Tagset>. C<%isBodyMarkup> is not implemented in HTML::Tagset, so
it's not provided for compatibility here.

=head2 %isCDATA_Parent

This hashset includes all elements whose content is CDATA.

This is copied from HTML::Tagset.

=head2 %isFormElement

This hashset contains all elements that are to be found only in/under
a "form" element.

This is compatible with HTML::Tagset.

=head2 %isHeadElement

This hashset contains elements that can be present in the 'head'
section of an HTML document.

This is compatible with the contents of
C<%HTML::Tagset::isHeadElement>, but not its documentation. See also
L</Issues with HTML::Tagset>.

=head2 %isHeadOrBodyElement

This hashset includes all elements that can fall either in the head or
in the body.

This is compatible with HTML::Tagset.

=head2 %isHTML2

This hashset is true for elements which are part of the L</HTML 2.0>
standard.

This is only in HTML::Valid::Tagset, not in HTML::Tagset.

=head2 %isHTML3

This hashset is true for elements which are part of the L</HTML 3.2>
standard.

This is only in HTML::Valid::Tagset, not in HTML::Tagset.

=head2 %isHTML4

This hashset is true for elements which are part of the L</HTML 4.01>
standard.

This is only in HTML::Valid::Tagset, not in HTML::Tagset.

=head2 %isHTML5

[% INCLUDE "examples/is-html5.pl" | xtidy %]

outputs

[% INCLUDE "examples/is-html5-out.txt" | xtidy %]

This is true for elements which are valid HTML tags in L</HTML5>. It
is not true for obsolete elements like the <plaintext> tag (see
L</%isObsolete>), or proprietary elements such as the <blink> tag
which have never been part of any HTML standard (see
L</%isProprietary>). Further, some elements neither marked as obsolete
nor proprietary are also not present in HTML5. For example the
<isindex> tag is not present in HTML5.

This is only in HTML::Valid::Tagset, not in HTML::Tagset.

=head2 %isKnown

This hashset lists all known HTML elements. See also L</@allTags>.

This is compatible with HTML::Tagset.

=head2 %isList

This hashset contains all elements that can contain "li" elements.

This is copied from HTML::Tagset.

=head2 %isInline

This hashset contains all inline elements. It is identical to
C<%isPhraseMarkup>.

This is only in HTML::Valid::Tagset, not in HTML::Tagset.

=head2 %isObsolete

    $isObsolete{canvas};
    # Undefined
    $isObsolete{plaintext};
    # True

This is true for HTML elements which were once part of HTML standards,
like C<plaintext>, but have now been declared obsolete. Note that
C<%isObsolete> is not true for elements like the <blink> tag which
were never part of any HTML standard. See L</%isProprietary> for these
tags.

This is only in HTML::Valid::Tagset, not in HTML::Tagset.

=head2 %isPhraseMarkup

This hashset contains all inline elements. It is identical to
C<%isInline>.

This is compatible with HTML::Tagset.

=head2 %isProprietary

This is true for elements which are not part of any HTML standard, but
were added by computer companies.

[% INCLUDE "examples/proprietary.pl" | xtidy %]

outputs

[% INCLUDE "examples/proprietary-out.txt" | xtidy %]

This is only in HTML::Valid::Tagset, not in HTML::Tagset.

=head2 %isTableElement

This hashset contains all elements that are to be found only in/under
a "table" element.

This is compatible with HTML::Tagset.

=head2 %optionalEndTag

Elements in this hashset are not empty (see L</%emptyElement>), but their
end-tags are generally, "safely", omissible.

[% INCLUDE "examples/optional-end-tag.pl" | xtidy %]

outputs

[% INCLUDE "examples/optional-end-tag-out.txt" | xtidy %]

This is compatible with HTML::Tagset.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 all_attributes

    my $attr = all_attributes ();

This returns an array reference containing all known attributes. The
attributes are not sorted.

=head2 attributes

    my $attr = attributes ('a');

This returns an array reference containing all valid attributes for
the specified tag (as decided by the WWW Consortium). The attributes
are not sorted. By default this returns the valid tags for HTML 5.

It is also possible to choose a value for standard which specifies
which standard one wants:

    my $attr = attributes ('a', standard => 'html5');

Possible values for standard are

=over

=item html5

This returns valid attributes for L</HTML5>.

This is the default

=item html4

This returns valid attributes for L</HTML 4.01>.

=item html3

This returns valid attributes for L</HTML 3.2>.

=item html2

This returns valid attributes for L</HTML 2.0>.

=back

=head2 tag_attr_ok

    my $ok = tag_attr_ok ('a', 'onmouseover');
    # $ok = 1
    my $ok = tag_attr_ok ('table', 'cellspacing');
    # $ok = undef, because "cellspacing" is not a valid attribute for
    # table in HTML 5.

This returns a true value if the attribute is allowed for the
specified tag. The default version is HTML 5. Another version of HTML
can be specified using the parameter C<standard>:

    my $ok = tag_attr_ok ('html', 'onload', standard => 'html2');

The possible versions are as in L</attributes>.

=head2 attr_type

     my $type = attr_type ('onmouseover');
     # $type = 'script'

This returns a text string containing likely type information for the
attribute. This content is extracted from the internals of L</HTML Tidy>,
and it may or may not be correct. This interface is experimental, and
likely to change.

=head1 COMPATIBILITY-ONLY VARIABLES

These variables are present in this module for compatibility with
existing programs which use HTML::Tagset. However, they are
fundamentally flawed and should not be used for new projects.

=head2 %is_Possible_Strict_P_Content

In HTML::Valid::Tagset, this is identical to L</%isInline>.

This is a mistake in HTML::Tagset which is preserved in name only for
backwards compatibility.  See also L</Issues with HTML::Tagset>.

=head2 @p_closure_barriers

In HTML::Valid::Tagset, this resolves to an empty list.

This is a mistake in HTML::Tagset which is preserved in name only for
backwards compatibility. See also L</Issues with HTML::Tagset>.

=head1 UNIMPLEMENTED

The following parts of HTML::Tagset are not implemented in version [%
version %] of HTML::Valid::Tagset.

=head2 %boolean_attr

This is not implemented in HTML::Valid::Tagset.

=head1 BUGS

=head2 Issues with HTML::Tagset

There are several problems with HTML::Tagset version 3.20 which mean
that it's difficult to be fully compatible with it.

=over

=item C<@p_closure_barriers> should be an empty set

There is a long-winded argument in the documentation of HTML::Tagset,
which has been there since version 3.01, released on Aug 21 2000,
about why it's possible for a p element to contain another p
element. However, the specification for HTML4.01, which HTML::Tagset
seems to be based on, from 1999, states

=over

The P element represents a paragraph. It cannot contain block-level
elements (including P itself).

=back

Thus, it is simply not possible for any block element to legally be
part of a paragraph, and the mechanism that HTML::Tagset suggests for
how a paragraph element can contain a table which can contain a
paragraph element, like this:

     <p>
     <table>

is not and was not legal HTML, since <table> itself is a block level
element, and the HTML rule is that in the above case, if a new block
level element is seen, a </p> is inserted automatically, so it always
becomes

     <p>
     </p>
     <table>

anyway. See L</%isBlock> for testing for whether an element is a block
level element.

So in this module, L</@p_closure_barriers> is an empty set.

=item C<%is_Possible_Strict_P_Content> doesn't really make sense

The comments for HTML::Tagset version 3.20 read

    # I've no idea why there's these latter exceptions.
    # I'm just following the HTML4.01 DTD.

and following this it lists the C<form> tag in this hash. However, the
form tag is a block level element, so the purpose of this hash seems
to be misguided. Since, as noted above, a p tag can contain any inline
element, in this module, for compatibility,
L</%is_Possible_Strict_P_Content> is just the same thing as
L</%isInline>.

=item C<%isBodyMarkup> doesn't exist

The documented C<%isBodyMarkup> doesn't exist, in its place is
C<%isBodyElement>.

This is reported as
L<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=109024>.

=item The documentation of C<%isHeadElement> is misleading

The documentation of C<%isHeadElement> claims

=over

This hashset contains all elements that elements that should be
present only in the 'head' element of an HTML document.

=back

However, in fact it actually contains elements that can be present
either only in the head, like <title>, or both in the head and the
body, like <script>. In this module, L</%isHeadElement> copies the
contents of HTML::Tagset rather than its documentation.

The issue in HTML::Tagset is reported as
L<https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=109044>.

=item Some elements of C<%isHeadElement> are not head elements

This is reported as
L<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=109018>.
